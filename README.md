# Famo.us Planet App

I attended a 3-day workshop held by Famou.us. On the last day, we were encouraged to demo what we had learned. I decided to tap into Famo.us' physics engine and created a simple app to model gravity.

### Running the App:
1. Make sure to have [Bower](http://bower.io/) installed, or install it globally by running:
```sh
$ bower install -g bower
```
then in this project's root directory, install the dependencies:
```sh
$ bower install
```

2. Make sure to have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed, or install it globally by running::
grunt serve
```sh
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
 - if you don't want to install grunt, after install the project's dependincies, run:
```sh
$ open app/index.html
```
